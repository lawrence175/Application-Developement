                <h1>Malaria</h1>
                Malaria: the Number One Killer of Children in Africa
Malaria is a leading cause of child deaths in Africa.  According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, malaria is the 5th cause of death from infectious diseases worldwide (after respiratory infections, HIV/AIDS, diarrheal diseases, and tuberculosis).   Malaria is the 2nd leading cause of death from infectious diseases in Africa, after HIV/AIDS.

<br/>1.	Take the right type of anti-malarial medicines for the country you are travelling to. The choice of anti-malarial prevention tablets will also need to take into account your medical history, age and other concurrent medications. You must take them daily or weekly, depending on the medication choice, prior to travel and upon return from the malaria area.
<br/> 2.	Protect yourself from mosquito bites by sleeping under an insecticide-treated mosquito net.
<br/> 3.	Wear socks, long pants, long-sleeve shirts and blouses.
<br/> 4.	Spray DEET mosquito repellent onto your clothes and the exposed parts of your skin.
<br/> 5.	Make sure the room doors and windows are closed properly and screened with gauze to prevent mosquitoes from getting in.
<br/> 6.	Spray the room with an insecticide before entering.
<br/> 7.	Pregnant women and young children should avoid travelling to malaria-prone areas.
“It is important to check with your doctor or a travel clinic for the right anti-malarial for the country you are travelling to. Malaria treatment has become more challenging as malaria parasites grow increasingly drug-resistant,” says Dr Wijaya.</br>

                <h1>Tuberculosis</h1>
                <p>
                 1. Keeping the immune system healthy. Eat plenty of healthy foods including fruits and vegetables; get enough sleep, and exercise at least 30 minutes a day most days of the week to keep your immune system in top form.

                <br />2. Get tested regularly. Experts advise people who have a high risk of TB to get a skin test once a year. This includes people with HIV or other conditions that weaken the immune system, people who live or work in a prison or nursing home, healthcare workers, people from countries with high rates of TB, and others in high-risk groups.

                <br />3. Consider preventive therapy. If you test positive for latent TB infection, your doctor will likely advise you to take medications to reduce your risk of developing active TB.

                <br />4. Vaccination: This is one major preventive measure against TB. A vaccine called BCG does help strengthen the immune system. BCG is particularly effective in children. Discuss BCG vaccination with a doctor and ensure to be vaccinated if there is a need for it.
                <br />
                5.  Finish your entire course of medication. This is the most important step you can take to protect yourself and others from TB. When you stop treatment early or skip doses, TB bacteria have a chance to develop mutations that allow them to survive the most potent TB drugs. The resulting drug-resistant strains are much more deadly and difficult to treat.

<h1>Aids</h1>
    <p>
    1. Practice safe sex. This is paramount on the list. Says Dr. Englund, "Practicing safe sex is essential.”
    Understand how the virus is transmitted to reduce the risk of infecting others.
    Use condoms not only to avoid the spread of HIV, but also to protect both you and your partner against other sexually transmitted diseases (STDs) and other types of infections.

  </br>
    2. Get tested for other STDs. If you have another STD, also known as sexually transmitted infections, or STIs, you may be more likely to transmit both HIV and your other STD to someone else.
    STDs can also worsen HIV and make the disease progress more rapidly.
    And HIV can make STDs more difficult to treat, so you’ll want to address an STD as soon as possible.
    Getting tested is a must because many STDs don't cause any symptoms — without testing, you may not even realize you have one.

  </br>
    3. Prevent infections and illnesses. Since HIV makes your immune system less effective, you become more susceptible to every virus, bacteria, and germ you're exposed to.
     Wash your hands frequently, and stay away from sick people to stay as healthy as possible.
    Also stay up-to-date on all of your vaccinations to reduce your risk of preventable illnesses.

  </br>
    4. Follow doctor's orders about your prescriptions. It's crucial to take your HIV medication exactly as prescribed by your doctor.
    Skipping even one day of medication can give the virus an opportunity to become resistant to the drugs, making them ineffective against the virus, says Englund.
     Be sure to take prescriptions at the same time every day, and always have your medication with you so that if you are away from home, you won’t have to miss a dose.

   </br>
    5. Don't abuse drugs or alcohol. Alcohol and drug overuse can contribute to feelings of depression.
    Avoid illegal drugs and take prescription drugs as directed by your doctor to help protect your immune system.
    Avoiding drug abuse can also help to prevent cognitive (thinking and reasoning) impairment, which is important in minimizing HIV-related dementia.
  </br>
    6. Quit smoking. Giving up cigarettes is beneficial for anyone.
    Stopping all tobacco use will help you live healthier and feel better, according to Englund, as well as prevent a number of health problems and reduce your risk of serious events like heart attack and stroke.

  </br>
    7. Manage physical and emotional health problems. Depression is common among people with HIV, and the stress associated with having HIV can worsen depression symptoms.
    What’s more, both stress and depression can worsen physical pain associated with HIV.
    Keeping stress, depression, and pain under control can help improve your physical and emotional health, making life with HIV easier.
    See a mental health professional if you feel you’re experiencing depression, and be sure to mention that you’re taking medication for HIV to avoid potential drug interactions between depression and HIV medicines.

  </br>
    8. Exercise mind and body. Physical and mental exercise can keep your mind and body strong. Regular physical exercise, such as walking, biking, running, swimming, or another activity you enjoy, keeps you physically fit and can keep both stress and depression in check.
    Physical exercise significantly helps the immune system as well.
    Mental exercise — doing a daily crossword puzzle or playing brain-challenging games — can help maintain your cognitive health.
    Exercise your memory, concentration, and attention, all of which can be affected by HIV.

  </br>
    The keys to staying healthy with HIV are within your control. Live a healthy lifestyle.
    Fuel your body with a healthy, nutritious, and balanced diet, and allow it to recharge each night with enough quality sleep.
    Treat your body well to strengthen it, so that it can defend against illnesses that could threaten your health.

            <section id="cancer">
                <h1>Cancer</h1>
                <p>
                 1. When you're being treated for cancer, it's more important than ever to eat a healthy diet and get good nutrition -- but it can also be more difficult than ever. Your body is working overtime to fight the cancer, while it's also doing extra duty to repair healthy cells that may have been damaged as a side effect of treatments like chemotherapy and radiation. At the same time, many cancer treatments -- especially chemotherapy -- come with side effects that drain your strength and sap your appetite.<br />
                 2. Certain kinds of herbal supplements, like St. John's wort, can also interact badly with some types of cancer treatment. "Some complex herbal extracts may contain substances that can change drug metabolism, interfering with the way in which your body metabolizes chemotherapy," warns Deng. Talk to your doctor before taking any type of herbal product or supplement during cancer treatment.<br />
                 3. If you have trouble eating enough at mealtimes, many experts recommend adding a nutritional supplement nutrition drink to the menu. Check the label to make sure your supplement shake contains a variety of vitamins and minerals. Most 8-ounce nutritional supplement drinks are fortified to provide 25% of the vitamins you need each day.<br />

            <section id="heart">
                <h1>Heart</h1>
                <p>
                1. Stop smoking. Quitting smoking is the single most important thing a person can do to live longer. If you are a smoker, you are twice as likely to have a heart attack than a non-smoker. But from the moment you stop smoking, the risk of heart attack starts to reduce. With public smoking bans recently introduced, there has never been a better time to give up.<br />

                2. Cut down on salt. Too much salt can cause high blood pressure, which increases the risk of developing coronary heart disease. Avoid foods like crisps, salted nuts, canned and packet soups and sauces, baked beans and canned vegetables, pork pies, pizzas and ready meals. Many breakfast cereals and breads that appear healthy also contain high levels of salt, so keep your eye on these too.
                <br />
                3. Watch your diet. A healthy diet can help to reduce the risk of developing heart disease, and can also help increase the chances of survival after a heart attack. You should try to have a balanced diet, containing plenty of fresh fruit and vegetables, oily fish, starchy foods such as wholegrain bread, pasta and rice. Avoid foods like biscuits, cakes, pastries and dairy products that are high in saturated fats and sugar.
                <br />
                4. Monitor your alcohol. Too much alcohol can damage the heart muscle, increase blood pressure and also lead to weight gain. Binge drinking will increase your risk of having a heart attack, so you should aim to limit your intake to one to two units a day.
                <br />
                5. Get active.The heart is a muscle and it needs exercise to keep fit so that it can pump blood efficiently round your body with each heart beat. You should aim for 30 minutes of moderate intensity exercise a day. If this seems too daunting, start off gently and build up gradually. Keeping fit not only benefits your physical health - it improves your mental health and wellbeing too.
                <br />
                6. Manage your weight. The number of people who are overweight in Britain is rising fast - already more than half of the adult population is overweight or obese. Carrying a lot of extra weight as fat can greatly affect your health and increases the risk of life-threatening conditions such as coronary heart disease and diabetes. If you are overweight or obese, start by making small, but healthy changes to what you eat, and try to become more active.
                <br />
                7. Get your blood pressure and cholesterol levels checked by your GP. The higher your blood pressure, the shorter your life expectancy. People with high blood pressure run a higher risk of having a stroke or a heart attack. High levels of cholesterol in the blood - produced by the liver from saturated fats - can lead to fatty deposits in your coronary arteries that increase your risk of coronary heart disease, stroke, and diseases that affect the circulation. You can help lower your cholesterol level by exercising and eating high-fibre foods such as porridge, beans, pulses, lentils, nuts, fruits and vegetables.
                <br />
                8. Learn to manage your stress levels. If you find things are getting on top of you, you may fail to eat properly, smoke and drink too much and this may increase your risk of a heart attack.
                <br />
                9. Check your family history . If a close relative is at risk of developing coronary heart disease from smoking, high blood pressure, high cholesterol, lack of physical activity, obesity and diabetes, then you could be at risk too.
                <br />
                10. Make sure you can recognise the early signs of coronary heart disease . Tightness or discomfort in the chest, neck, arm or stomach which comes on when you exert yourself but goes away with rest may be the first sign of angina, which can lead to a heart attack if left untreated.
